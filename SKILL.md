description: Create a production-ready multi-view character identity card from one or more reference images plus optional art direction. Use for character identity locking, face-angle references, body turnarounds, rear-hairstyle references, and consistent AI image or video production. Clearly separate observed traits from requested or inferred details.

# Character Identity Card

Turn one or more character reference images plus optional art direction into a reusable, production-ready multi-view identity card for consistent AI image and video generation. Identity specifications and model-ready prompts support the card-generation workflow; they are not the primary product.

## Required inputs

- At least one usable character reference image.
- The user's custom direction: wardrobe, age/presentation, realism, intended platform, and any must-keep or must-change traits.

Multiple angles improve reliability but are not mandatory. Separate what is **observed**, **requested**, and **inferred**. Never present inferred anatomy, body proportions, or hidden details as facts from the source image.

Before generating or editing, inspect every local image with the available image-viewing tool. Label each input image's role: identity anchor, body/wardrobe reference, style reference, or layout reference.

## Choose the deliverable

1. **Identity card (default)** — a generated multi-panel card plus the observed/requested/inferred specification and validation notes.
2. **Identity specification only** — a reusable identity lock without generating an image; include prompts only when requested or operationally useful.
3. **Platform adaptation** — adapt the locked identity and card instructions for a named image/video platform.

If the user supplies references and direction without naming a deliverable, default to an identity card. For a card, use the image-generation capability and read [references/card-spec.md](references/card-spec.md) before generation. Read [references/prompt-template.md](references/prompt-template.md) when drafting the generation prompt or an optional platform prompt.

## Core workflow

1. Extract only visually supported identity anchors: facial geometry, hair silhouette, complexion range, apparent age range, body silhouette, wardrobe, and distinctive asymmetries.
2. Resolve contradictions across references by prioritizing, in order: the user's explicit instruction, the designated identity anchor, repeated evidence across images, then cautious inference.
3. Produce an identity lock that describes relationships and proportions, not vague beauty adjectives.
4. Select a body-panel mode:
   - `headless-body` for reliable distant-body assets. The front and side/three-quarter body panels are cleanly framed from the collar/shoulder line to the shoes, with white negative space above. The 180-degree back body panel is the required exception: show the complete rear figure from the back of the head to the shoes so the rear hairstyle and head silhouette remain visible. It must face directly away and reveal no facial features or side-face profile. Do not blur, mosaic, pixelate, erase, or show an anatomical neck stump.
   - `full-head` when the user explicitly needs conventional full-body turnarounds and accepts the higher risk of face drift.
5. Generate the card from the references, preserving identity and wardrobe. The reference image is evidence, not an edit target, unless the user explicitly requests an edit.
6. Inspect the result for identity drift, panel completeness, limb errors, garment inconsistency, accidental face content in the headless front/side panels, and a missing, cropped, or face-revealing head in the back panel. Make at most two focused revisions unless the user asks to continue.
7. Return the final image and the observed/requested/inferred identity specification. Also return the exact generation prompt for reproducibility; add a compact platform prompt when requested or useful for a point-consuming tool.

## Non-negotiable invariants

- Every clear face panel must depict the same person: consistent skull shape, eye spacing, nose structure, lip shape, jawline, ears, hairline, hair color, and apparent age.
- Body panels must keep the same height impression, shoulder width, torso-to-leg ratio, garment construction, colors, accessories, and footwear.
- In `headless-body` mode, the back panel must preserve the complete rear head and hairstyle. If the reference does not show the rear hairstyle, derive the most conservative continuation of the visible hair silhouette and label it as inferred rather than observed.
- Use a neutral white studio background, soft standardized lighting, and panel separators. Do not introduce scenery, props, logos, captions, watermarks, or decorative typography unless requested.
- Preserve natural skin microtexture without beauty-filter smoothing, plastic skin, fake pore noise, aggressive sharpening, or exaggerated HDR.
- A reference-based result is an approximation. Do not claim the original generator prompt, seed, LoRA, model, or hidden settings were recovered.
- For an identifiable real person's likeness, confirm the user has permission for the intended reuse when that is not already clear. Do not frame an unauthorized likeness replica as a reusable commercial identity.

## Output structure

Keep the analysis concise and production-oriented:

```text
Mode: identity card | identity specification | platform adaptation
Body-panel mode: headless-body | full-head
Observed identity anchors: ...
Requested direction: ...
Inferred or unresolved details: ...
Identity lock: ...
Exact generation prompt: ... (for identity-card output)
Compact platform prompt: ... (optional)
Validation notes: ...
```

When an image is generated, save the final selected asset into the current workspace and report its absolute path.
